Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and the manipulation of text. Understanding how regex expressions work is important when defining search patterns. Once a search pattern is identified, tasks such as searching, validating, extracting, replacing, and formatting become possible.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will be exploring the regular expression /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/ for matching a URL. This regex is used specifically to match and validate URLs with optional HTTP or HTTPS protocols. Each component in this example has a unique purpose which is what we will be diving into now.
